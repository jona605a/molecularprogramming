\section{Evaluation}

This project on CRN++ implementation gave us a hands-on opportunity to deepen our understanding of the F\# programming language while diving into the intriguing world of chemical computation. We successfully enhanced the grammar and integrated matrix operations for more efficient ODE solutions, making our simulations significantly faster. These improvements allowed us to handle larger cases and in combination with our visualization tools, it offered clearer insights into the chemical processes.

Despite these advancements, we encountered challenges, particularly in executing operations within each step correctly to mimic the intended chemical behaviours. This highlighted the importance of proper sequence execution, which we aimed to address through topological sorting in our interpreter â€” a goal we unfortunately ran out of time to fully implement.
